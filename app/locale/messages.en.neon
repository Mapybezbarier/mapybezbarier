Therefore,  a public API was created allowing you to select the exported data not only according to criteria corresponding to filter of the web applications, but also on the basis of a region, a municipality or its part. It is also possible to restrict the exported data by date of last modification option for incremental exports. More information incl. a description of the individual formats can be found in %startTag%specifikaci API%endTag%."
